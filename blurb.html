<h2>PhD in Statistics</h2>
<p>Josh has a PhD in Statistical Applied Mathematics at the University of Bath, looking at <i>developing efficient statistical tools for problems arising in spatio-temproal modelling</i>. He was supervised by <a href="https://people.bath.ac.uk/man54/">Prof Matt Nunes<a> and <a href="https://roysandipan.github.io/">Dr Sandipan Roy<a>.</p><p>The issue of fitting high-dimension models when analysing spatio-temporal data in applications such as in environmental, ecological, or epidemiological settings is a well known problem. He developed novel methods to leverage contextual spatial information to produce more parsimonious, interpretable models, through using approximate low-rank and sparse representations.</p><p>This proceedure could then be deployed as part of the data analysis pipeline in improving model fit, forecasting, and change-point detection. To demostrate the advantages of his approach, he developed R scripts implementing his model, designed experiments and generated reports of the results from comparative simulations as part of his thesis.</p>
